# HadronicLineshapes

The `HadronicLineshapes` a Julia package provides models for description of hadronic scattering processes within particle physics.

## Installation

To install `HadronicLineshapes`, use the Julia package manager. From the Julia REPL, enter package mode by pressing `]`, then run:

```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/mmikhasenko/HadronicLineshapes.jl
```

Ensure that you have Julia installed on your system and that the `Parameters` package, a dependency of `HadronicLineshapes`, is also installed using the same method.

## Usage and API Reference

### Basic Usage

```julia
using HadronicLineshapes

# Create a Breit-Wigner constant-width lineshape function
bw = BreitWigner(1.6, 0.2)
```

### API Overview

All of the lineshapes are inherited from `AbstractFlexFunc` enabling mathematical operations
on the functions like multiplication and composition.

- **`AbstractFlexFunc`**: Base type for flexible function operations.

- **Utility Types and Functions**:
    - `WrapFlexFunction`
    - `ComposeFlexFunc`
    - `ScaleFlexFunc`
    - `ProductFlexFunc`

These types and functions provide a versatile set of tools for creating and manipulating lineshape functions, supporting operations like composition, scaling, and forming products.

## Test Cases

The package includes comprehensive tests covering various functionalities, including `BreitWigner` and `BlattWeisskopf` implementations and their operations. Users are encouraged to explore the test section for examples of validating the accuracy and performance of the lineshape functions and report the issues.

Here is an example of Blatt-Weisskopf form-factors for orbital momentum from 1 to 5.

```julia
let
    plot()
    map((1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) do l
        ff = BlattWeisskopf{l}(1.5)
        plot!(x -> ff(x), 0, 5.0)
    end
    plot!()
end
```

A comparison of a resonance lineshapes for different form-factors is constructed as below.

```julia
let m = 0.77, Γ = 0.15
    ρ(e) = sqrt(e - 0.28) # phase space stuff
    plot()
    bw = BreitWigner(m, Γ)
    plot!(0.28, 0.7, lab="const width") do e
        e * angle(bw(e^2))
    end
    bw = BreitWigner(m, Γ, 0.14, 0.14, 1, 5.0)
    plot!(0.28, 0.7, lab="P-wave (5/Gev)") do e
        e * angle(bw(e^2))
    end
    bw = BreitWigner(m, Γ, 0.14, 0.14, 1, 1.5)
    plot!(0.28, 0.7, lab="P-wave (1.5/Gev)") do e
        e * angle(bw(e^2))
    end
    vline!([m], lab="")
end
```
